   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some people have no problem being motivated to be excellent every single day. I am not one of those people. While I love what I do, I think I can do better. It is very easy to make excuses for why I have countless side projects around 20% completion. Maybe people believe me when I say &amp;quot;I just don&amp;#39;t have time right now.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve just been slammed at work.&amp;quot;. Those excuses are bullshit. There are plenty of people with may more on their plate than I. That is why I want to embark on a new adventure -- &amp;quot;A Year of Commits&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next year, I will make at least 1 commit per day to a &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt; repository on github. I am counting the commits by the day they are made, not they day they are merged in (in cases of public PRs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I will make 1 blog post per week. That&amp;#39;s 52 blog posts total counting this one (in case for some reason you don&amp;#39;t know how many weeks are in a year or whatever). It&amp;#39;s my first blog so who knows what will happen. Do people put pictures in blogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who cares? Why would I go through the trouble of making this blog to exist alongside the gazillion other ones out there? Because I want to. I think it will be not only a great motivator for me but potentially provide some comic relief to any wandering interneters that happen to stumble upon this joke of a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
