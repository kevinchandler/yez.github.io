   <title>Ruby Boolean</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Week one of my &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/23/a_year_of_commits/&quot;&gt;Year of Commits&lt;/a&gt; initiative is complete, 51 more to go. I did not plan on telling people about this until a few weeks into the task (in case history repeated itself and I gave up 20% in). But that didn&amp;#39;t happen; people found out about it almost immediately, demonstrating yet again just how easy it is to find anything on the Internet. Thanks, Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened in the first week? Did I change the world of open source forever? Did I contribute a monumental change to one of the most well renown ruby libraries out there? Nope, I made a gem that at its core is 3 lines long. I made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yez/ruby-boolean&quot;&gt;boolean gem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that most people would wonder: &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why did he make this useless thing? Doesn&amp;#39;t he know that ruby does not have the boolean type &lt;a href=&quot;http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/96356&quot;&gt;by design&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot;. The answer is simple. I found myself over and over again typing some kind of nonsense like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# For some reason we need to know if this value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# is a boolean or not&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# @boolean?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   param: value - what we want to know is a boolean or not&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#   return: true/false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;boolean?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;TrueClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;FalseClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, however, could also be questioned. &amp;quot;Who cares if something is a boolean or not? This is ruby, duck-type that shiz&amp;quot;. Sure, that makes sense, I can do that. But do I want to do that? No. Why not? Because sometimes knowing the type of something can be important. You might not always have a background process like ActiveRecord&amp;#39;s type coercion to clean up your types for you. Or maybe you actually want something to be a boolean, not &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;f&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gem is not alone. Other gems that do similar and much more functionality exist as well (i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/bool/versions/1.0.20&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/RISCfuture/boolean&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yez/ruby-boolean&quot;&gt;ruby-boolean gem&lt;/a&gt;, the same kind of code can be re-written:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Super important business logic method&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;some_method_where_booleans_matter&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;is_a?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Do boolean related stuff&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Throw a fit about it not being a boolean&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! Now I only have to check one class instead of two. My life is now perfect, what could possibly make this any better? Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was a fun introduction to the 365 commit-a-thon I am embarking on. Maybe someone will even use it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some people have no problem being motivated to be excellent every single day. I am not one of those people. While I love what I do, I think I can do better. It is very easy to make excuses for why I have countless side projects around 20% completion. Maybe people believe me when I say &amp;quot;I just don&amp;#39;t have time right now.&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve just been slammed at work.&amp;quot;. Those excuses are bullshit. There are plenty of people with may more on their plate than I. That is why I want to embark on a new adventure -- &amp;quot;A Year of Commits&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next year, I will make at least 1 commit per day to a &lt;strong&gt;public&lt;/strong&gt; repository on github. I am counting the commits by the day they are made, not they day they are merged in (in cases of public PRs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I will make 1 blog post per week. That&amp;#39;s 52 blog posts total counting this one (in case for some reason you don&amp;#39;t know how many weeks are in a year or whatever). It&amp;#39;s my first blog so who knows what will happen. Do people put pictures in blogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who cares? Why would I go through the trouble of making this blog to exist alongside the gazillion other ones out there? Because I want to. I think it will be not only a great motivator for me but potentially provide some comic relief to any wandering interneters that happen to stumble upon this joke of a blog.&lt;/p&gt;
